# The hackathon aka The Great Hacka 2023
The idea for this competition was to predict the concentration of pollen for the upcoming 3 days based on the previous 10 days.<br>
The hackathon competition was held on kaggle and the end results for the models we're the following:<br>

# How the competition went
We had a lot of fun working together in a team and also gained a lot of knowledge. The hackathon was competitive to the finish as<br>
the leaderboard was changing dynamically every moment. All the teams were trying to grasp even the slightest form of improvement<br>
on their models considering the difference between scores being in decimal points. The competition was tough due to it lasting 24h<br>
and a lot of teams getting almost no sleep considering almost all of us stayed overnight, but it was very exciting due to the reasons<br>
mentioned and the awesome people that we're a part of it. The organizers we're caring as well and ready to support.
